description which is\n\n724\n00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:26,080\nclearly in Korean and we have a price\n\n725\n00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:28,559\nper night and um the problem is all\n\n726\n00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,240\nexisting Data Systems work like this\n\n727\n00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,320\neven on Airbnb right now right so if I\n\n728\n00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,960\nstore this this this piece of data this\n\n729\n00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,240\nis literally what's stored in the\n\n730\n00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,200\ndatabase but what we're instructing the\n\n731\n00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,240\nmodel with is that name so here you see\n\n732\n00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,440\nname and description here you see\n\n733\n00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,200\ndescription should be in English so what\n\n734\n00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,880\nnow happens is that if we store that\n\n735\n00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,039\ndata and we get it back so we say fetch\n\n736\n00:29:51,880 -->

00:43:38,720\nanswer and if you have real-time use\n\n1011\n00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,640\ncases that's problematic and therefore\n\n1012\n00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,720\nthere was these algorithms were um\n\n1013\n00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,319\ninvented are called approximate nearest\n\n1014\n00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,079\nneighbor algorithms and um the U what\n\n1015\n00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:52,520\nyou basically did was that these\n\n1016\n00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:55,280\nalgorithms were uh able to very fast do\n\n1017\n00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:56,760\nFactor comparison at the cost of\n\n1018\n00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,319\napproximation\n\n1019\n00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:02,359\nso you can't have a 100% guarantee that\n\n1020\n00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:03,760\num the the actual nearest neighbors are\n\n1021\n00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:07,760\nthe actual nearest\n\n1022\n00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,800\nneighbors you might miss one if you will\n\n1023\n00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,800\nbut the thing is like there's there's so\n\n1024\n00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,400\nmuch faster that the tradeoff is\n\n1025\n00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,440\nperfectly fine is and we're not talking\n\n1026\n00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,880\nabout like 80% uh and 20% but we're\n\n1027\n00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,240\ntalking about like\n\n1028\n00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,800\n99 whatever percent but not 100 right so\n\n1029\n00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,319\nthat tradeoff that was like um veryable\n\n1030\n00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,359\nnow the thing was if you open up
