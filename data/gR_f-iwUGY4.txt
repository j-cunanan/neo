hello and welcome to a special episode of 
after skool i'm andrew huberman professor of   neurobiology and ophthalmology at stanford school 
of medicine i'm also the host of the hubermann   lab podcast a weekly podcast focused on science 
and science-based tools for everyday life today   you're going to learn about practical tools for 
optimizing your morning routine so without further   ado practical tools for optimizing your morning 
routine there are certain foundational behaviors   do's and don'ts that set the stage for you to 
be better at everything so a lot of times people   say how can i lift more focus better remember 
things better it's like well let's think about   the foundation of that and that's always 
going to come back to two elements and   that's sleep and what i call non-sleep 
deep rest so sleep is the fundamental   practice or part of our 24-hour cycle where 
if you don't get it on a consistent basis you   are down regulating your ability to do everything 
right metabolism is screwed up immune system is   screwed up etc etc however it is not the case 
if you get a one night's bad sleep or that if   you're not sleeping perfectly that you can't 
perform well but let's talk about sleep and just   because i think it's important the goal for most 
people unless you're pulling vampire shifts on   on deployment or you're a shift worker and thank 
you shift workers we'll talk about shift work   you should try and get really good sleep eighty 
percent of the time eight percent of the nights   of your life the other twenty percent i hope 
you're not getting good sleep for good reasons   that you enjoy but the point is that there are 
a couple things that you can do first of all   every cell in your body has a circadian rhythm 
meaning every cell has a 24-hour circadian clock   that's regulated by genes think of these your body 
is a bunch of millions of clock to need to align   those clocks to a single time this is why when 
you travel overseas your gut goes off or it's   more easy you more easily you get sick or uh your 
thinking isn't quite right the clocks aren't in   alignment they're not entrained as we say number 
one practice for everything sleep especially is   try and get some natural light in your eyes within 
an hour of waking up if you wake up before the sun   turn on a bunch of bright lights and then 
get sunlight in your eyes once it comes out   if there's dense cloud cover there 
are still more photons light energy   coming through that cloud cover than there are 
coming from artificial lights so try and get   five to ten minutes without sunglasses 
outside in the morning once the sun is out   most days if not all days this has an outsized 
effect on a number of things first of all it   modulates the timing of what's called the cortisol 
pulse once every 24 hours you're going to get a   boost in cortisol big spike in cortisol it's a 
healthy boost it sets your temperature rhythm   in motion sets your level of alertness your 
level of focus and your mood you want that   cortisol pulse to happen as early in the day 
as once what's triggering the cortisol pulse   the cortisol pulse is naturally entrained by these 
genetic programs to happen once every 24 hours but   light will anchor it to the period where you see 
bright light got it a late-shifted cortisol pulse   so imagine the kid that wakes up and spends the 
morning in bed or you spend the morning bedding   you're texting or you're indoors and you're 
typing on the computer that's not enough light to   accomplish what i'm talking about and then you go 
outside around noon or one you're in what's called   the circadian dead zone which is the time in which 
light arriving at the eyes can do certain things   but it can't time this pulse that means that 
cortisol pulse is going to come in the afternoon   which means that your temperature rhythm is going 
to be shifted late and that's actually a signature   of depression and anxiety and difficulty falling 
asleep many people are waking up and they're just   spending time indoors and they're putting on 
sunglasses getting in their car and driving or   there's cloud cover and they think there's no sun 
out i don't mean that you actually have to stare   at the sun never stare at any light so bright 
it's going to damage you please don't and blink as   necessary but the indirect rays from the from sun 
trigger these cells in the eyes called melanopsin   ganglion cells these ganglion cells these are our 
neurons they send a signal to your hypothalamus   then the hypothalamus releases this peptide which 
is a wake-up signal for your whole brain and body   and sets a timer for the onset of melatonin 
release 16 hours later melatonin being the   hormone that makes you sleepy and makes you want 
to go to sleep so you can imagine what happens if   you don't get that light until a few hours later 
everything shifted and then you want to go to st   you don't know why you're wide awake at 11 30 or 
12 and everything's messed up the other thing is   that you can get bright light from electronic 
devices early in the day but it's not enough   you need photons from sunlight now if you live in 
scandinavia in the depths of winter if you're up   in like you know trondheim or ohus or something 
like okay fine don't buy an expensive daytime   simulator get one of these led light boxes for 
drawing they're very inexpensive in comparison you   find them on amazon i don't have a relationship 
to any of these brands but they're easy to find   20 30 bucks put that on your desk and just look 
at that thing for a few minutes in the morning   not as good but better than being in the 
darkness then when the sun's out get outside   now this is a huge huge effect for the following 
reason the signal that arrives from the eyes to   the hypothalamus also triggers the release of the 
neuromodulator dopamine we hear about dopamine as   a feel-good molecule dopamine dopamine dopamine 
dopamine hits but dopamine's main role in the   brain and body is to drive motivation craving 
and pursuit it is not the molecule of pleasure   it is the molecule of drive it is life force 
dopamine is actually the molecule from which   adrenaline epinephrine is manufactured and you may 
notice you said we crave sun it also does make you   feel good here's why if you think about seasonally 
breeding animals let's think about the arctic fox   well the arctic fox in winter is white but in the 
summertime has darker pellets it actually there's   a pathway going from sunlight to dopamine 
to melanin production in the skin in fur so   animals that transition from light color to dark 
color that's all mediated by dopamine guess what   else happens the gonads grow there are animals 
that i've worked on in the laboratory and that   also in humans it's now been shown in 
a beautiful study that people who get   20 to 30 minutes of light on their skin this was 
a study done in israel so they wear an appropriate   amount of clothing but they're sleeveless no 
hat no sunglasses they were told to go outside   20 or 30 minutes three times a week just in 
the sunshine ideally they were shorts also   they measure testosterone and estrogen in men 
and women significant increases in both and   all the associated things of increased passion 
blah blah blah that is what they measured in the   study why well it turns out that light to the 
eyes but also light to the skin the skin is an   endocrine organ it's not just something to tattoo 
and hang earrings from and put clothing on and   actually there's a pathway involving a molecule 
called p53 and the keratinocytes are these skin   cells that when sunlight when uvb ultraviolet 
blue light penetrates the skin because it can   penetrate the skin superficially triggers these 
keratinocytes to stimulate a pathway that releases   dopamine in the brain and body so you feel better 
when you're getting light in your eyes and on   your skin and you're increasing testosterone 
and epinephrine and dopamine increase that's   why you feel good in the summer months people in 
scandinavia know this this kind of spring fever   in the winter months you want to go through every 
bit of effort to double or triple the amount of   time that you're spending outside in the morning 
so instead of 10 minutes make it 30 minutes   we all are familiar with getting sleepy and 
falling asleep that's the parasympathetic   nervous system taking over the longer we are 
awake the longer the buildup of something called   adenosine in the brain and body and adenosine 
turns on the parasympathetic nervous system   suppresses the sympathetic nervous system when 
we sleep adenosine is pushed back down what   is caffeine caffeine effectively through 
some chemical steps blocks the effects of   adenosine so if you wait so here's a little trick 
if you that's i don't like the word hacks because   hacks imply using something for a purpose it 
wasn't designed for here we're talking about   hardwired biology but if you wake up in the 
morning and you didn't sleep quite as much   as you would have liked that means and you're 
sleepy that means you still have a buildup of   adenosine in your system let's say you immediately 
reach for caffeine great you suppress the action   of that adenosine and you will be more alert 
and guess what happens then the caffeine wears   off and the adenosine binds to the receptors with 
greater affinity and you have your afternoon crash   so a practice that's very useful to people is 
to delay the intake of caffeine by 60 to 90   minutes after waking allow the adenosine to be 
cleared out because it's not just cleared out   in sleep it's also cleared out in those kind 
of sleepy states of early morning so allow it   to be cleared out the other thing that clears it 
out exercise exercise so when you get up in the   morning you're kind of sleepy i don't want to do 
this i don't want to do this but you hydrate and   train you clear out the adenosine now i like to 
drink caffeine before i train her during training   i'm weak like that but for people that have an 
afternoon crash this can have tremendous benefits   of and maybe start by pushing it out 15 minutes 
per day most everyone that does this says oh my   goodness i didn't understand why in the afternoon 
i'm crashing so hard this will really really help so let me ask you this i have a sense for you what 
time do you wake up typically generally between   well between 4 15 and 4 30. okay so for 
most people it's gonna be a little bit later   probably but for you that means so you're waking 
up if it's because of an alarm it's because of an   alarm but you're if that's your natural wake-up 
time now without an alarm that means that your   temperature is starting to rise at that time 
that's why you wake up that temperature increase   triggers that cortisol release now and that's why 
some people wake up right before their alarm clock   it's this cortisol pulse okay and two hours before 
that so for you approximately 2 30 in the morning   is what we call your temperature minimum it's when 
your temperature is lowest that it's ever going to   be in the 24 hour cycle so the way it works is 
you wake up because of an increase in core body   temperature that increase in core body temperature 
triggers that increase in cortisol and by viewing   light at that time you entrain you you ensure 
that it happens at the same time the next day the   clocks of your body are matched to this cortisol 
pulse so viewing bright light in the morning   anchors it when we say entrained it it tel through 
a circuit that involves cells in the eye and cells   in the hypothalamus which then talk to the rest of 
the cells of the body through a signal a peptide   that's released make sure that the temperature 
starts rising goes up up up up up and sometime   around two or three in the afternoon you're going 
to hit your temperature maximum you might feel a   little sleepy at that time but that's actually 
the time in which your gut your all your systems   are kind of revving at the maximum capacity 
and then it's going to start to drop and start   to drop drop drop now that drop in temperature 
eventually will be a full one to 3 degrees below   what your temperature maximum and that's when 
you're going to get sleepy and fall asleep   this is why it's important to keep 
the room cool at night to fall asleep the goal here is to increase body temperature in 
order to be awake and to decrease body temperature   in order to be asleep if we stay with those 
themes a lot of this will just fall into bins   exercising will increase body temperature somewhat 
paradoxically getting into a cold shower or cold   water everyone says what must make you cold 
right well if you stay in there a long time   to become hypothermic right but let's remember 
the thermostat example you have a little area in   your brain called the medial pre-optic area and if 
you make the surface of your body cold guess what   happens core body temperature goes up so getting 
into so if you're going to do ice baths or cold   showers you can do i would say do them sometime 
better than not at all there's a beautiful paper   published in the european journal physiology 
in the year 2000 which took people and had them   sit they actually had them on lawn chairs in 
water a pool it's a great way to run an experiment   i always say people ask about cold showers 
they're not a lot of experiments on cold   showers because think about it's very hard to 
control is everyone under the shower the same   way et cetera you put someone up in water up 
to their neck it is you know what you're doing   so there's it's experimental rigor that drives 
that but they had people get into reasonably   cool water 60 degrees fahrenheit so it's not 
that cool but they had them stand for an hour   or they've had people get into very cold water 
something like 40 degrees for just 20 seconds   now here's what's really interesting that shock 
that you referred to is a adrenaline also called   epinephrine and it is released from the adrenals 
obviously but also from a site in the brain called   locus ceruleus a little area of the brainstem 
that then sprinklers the rest of the brain with   epinephrine and wakes up the rest of the brain so 
that shock occurs in the brain and the body and   actually the stuff in the body doesn't cross the 
blood-brain barrier so you're a two-part system   when those two systems are aligned it's beautiful 
when those two systems are out of alignment that's   not good so you get into cold water that's the 
shock for the first 30 seconds for most people who   are untrained your forebrain which is controlling 
decision making is basically suppressed in its   activity and other areas are ramped up so just 
know that exact panic just understand that passes   then what happens is when you get out of the cold 
whether or not it's a longer period at 60 degrees   or a short period i would hate to hear that people 
are only doing 20 seconds but maybe a minute to   three minutes at 45 degrees or something there's 
a long arc release of dopamine and epinephrine   that's what was shown in the study in humans 
because people always go well it's just in mice no   in humans and that long arc of dopamine leads to a 
near doubling or more of dopamine and epinephrine   in my colleague anna lembke's book called 
dopamine nation she works on addiction runs   our dual diagnosis addiction clinic at stanford 
she talked about a patient of hers that basically   helped himself get over cocaine addiction by doing 
cold baths because it was the only thing that   would give him the kind of dopamine release that 
even slightly mimicked his cocaine addiction and   allowed himself to wean himself off with a 
healthier behavior now i'm not saying it's the   equivalent of a drug like cocaine but i am saying 
that it's a better decision than than a drug like   cocaine for obvious reasons so that mood-enhancing 
effect that you feel afterwards it's real   it's based on a real neurochemical effect 
and that dopamine and epinephrine will   combine with the temperature increase from 
cortisol plus light plus exercise all things   that increase core body temperature now you've 
got increased core body temperature you created   a dopamine release epinephrine you've created a 
summer month inside your body in the in i don't   care if you live in minneapolis in the depths of 
winter or someplace even as cold as new hampshire   you are you are creating summer in your body by 
doing that now if you live in san diego or los   angeles or arizona and it's the summer and you're 
staying indoors and you're on your phone and   you're not doing any movement until the afternoon 
which is fine exercise in the afternoon i realize   there's some important benefits of that and you're 
laying in bed or you're just walking around the   kitchen and putting on sunglasses and driving 
to work guess what you're creating a colorado   winter inside of your body despite the fact that 
the sun is out so if you're wondering why you're   slightly depressed your metabolism is lower your 
testosterone output is slightly lower than maybe   you'd like it to be there could be other reasons 
too of course but again we're talking about   modulators i'm not saying getting sun in your eyes 
in the morning is going to make your testosterone   perfect what i'm saying is you're you're setting 
an internal milieu through things that increase   core body temperature dopamine epinephrine etc and 
that should be done relatively early in the day   thank you for joining for this special 
episode of after skool if you'd like to   learn more tools for mental health physical 
health and performance check out the huberman   lab podcast which is available on all platforms 
youtube apple spotify anywhere podcasts are found   also check out huberman lab on both instagram and 
twitter there i cover science and science-based   tools some of which overlaps with the content
