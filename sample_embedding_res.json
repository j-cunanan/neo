    "content": "# From steam engines to generative AI\n\nFebruary 27, 2024 | 4 min read\n\nGenerative AI models are the steam engine of today's AI revolution.\n\nThis is the analogy I use to help guide my mind to not get swept by the raging flood of information today. Thinking of GenAI models this way allows me to find connections between the industries in the past that were greatly impacted by the arrival of the steam engine with the industries of today. It also helps me ask questions about upcoming key moments to come. What would be the equivalent of the internal combustion engine? What about the widespread use of electricity?\n\n### Mental shifts\n\nSteam engines brought the mental shift towards the idea that we can control energy transformation as long as we build the right machine. H.G. Wells took this idea even further in his book The Time Machine. Notice in the book that the time machine is operated using a bunch of levers and knobs! Very mechanical much like in their time.\n\nToday, AI researchers have realized and proven that as long as you have data you can train an AI model to take inputs such as text, image, audio and video, and generate new content into any of these modalities.\n\nWe’ve seen what large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot can do. I use both and surely it took me from zero to mediocre in Typescript allowing me to build web apps. If we generalize this idea of allowing anyone to jump from zero to mediocre level at anything using AI, how would society change?\n\n### Energy then, Information now\n\nFor the longest time in human history, muscle power has been the only energy converter available. With humans and animals providing muscle power, most activities in life are bound by the cycle of plant seasons and sunlight which powers the muscles, our food-to-movement converter.\n\nThis bottleneck was unlocked during the Industrial Revolution with the arrival of a heat-to-movement converter - the steam engine. Transforming our society in ways we never went back like having a standard time.\n\nBefore GenAI, the human brain was the only general information converter available. A translator's job can be described as a text-to-text conversion. A customer support’s job is a questions-to-suggestions conversion. Both jobs are now enhanced or completely replaced by AI.\n\nGenAI excels at information conversion. It is the only thing it does.\n\nThat is why the conventional way of writing what an AI model does is the pattern *InputModality-to-OutputModality*. Among the most popular ones today are speech-to-text (Whisper), text-to-image (StableDiffusion), text-to-speech (ElevenLabs) and image-to-video (RunwayML Gen-2).\n\n### It is still early\n\nMuch like a steam engine is not a train, it is what made trains move. GenAI is not the solution itself but the engine that powers innovative solutions across industries. We are still at the very early stage of an era but with an exponentially increasing pace of development.\n\nOne such development is called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Simply put, it rewrites the user’s prompt to an LLM in a way that includes relevant pieces of information from the user’s own data. Imagine asking a stranger to cook a dish for you and giving your personal recipe, it will guide them to your taste instead of making something generic.\n\nIs RAG gonna lead us to the internal combustion engine moment? Time will tell. What we know and experience is that it works. Several products out there now will not be possible with it.\n\nIf you ask ChatGPT what are the top 3 professions to be impacted by AI the answer will be: Writing and Content Creation, Legal Profession and Customer Service. Indeed, multiple startups that appeared recently are based on these 3 fields. These straightforward ways of using AI are akin to building steam-powered carts and pumps after learning about steam engines. There are still too many things left to be built, most of which have not even crossed our imagination.\n\nUnlike steam engines where the experimentations for potential applications require manpower and raw materials, exploring potential AI applications only requires compute resources like your laptop. With free usage credits on most platforms available, getting started has never been easier.\n\nSo how can we find startup ideas in this era of rapid AI evolution? Paul Graham says the word for it should be “notice” - by having a prepared mind we should notice gaps and build them.\n\n[← Back to home](/)\n",
